# Landing page

This is my first complete webpage, using HTML and CSS content on The Odin Project (TOP).

As far as you can check this landing webpage has been made using a desktop with a 1903x1630px widescreen only.

I did not use any of the responsive stuff yet to get the different devices messures and fit em in the page.

Despite this, the TOP includes a responsive lesson as a part of the Odins path.

## Contributing

If you have a suggestion to improve an exercise, an idea for a new exercise, or notice an issue with an exercise, please feel free to open an issue after thoroughly reading our [contributing guide](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) in our main TOP repo.

## How To Use These Exercises 

1. Fork and clone this repository. To learn how to fork a repository, see the GitHub documentation on how to [fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo). 
    * Copies of repositories on your machine are called clones. If you need help cloning to your local environment you can learn how from the GitHub documentation on [cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository).
2. Go to an exercise directory and open the HTML file in your browser. You can either open the file directly, or use something like VSCode's Live Server extension.
3. For each exercise, read the README thoroughly before starting any work.
    * Each README has a "Self Check" list. Use this to make sure you haven't missed any important details in your implementation.
4. Make your edits in the `index.html` and/or the `style.css` files in order to make the output in your browser look like the Desired Outcome image(s). 
    * Depending on the instructions of the exercise, you may only need to make edits in one of these files.
5. Once you successfully finish an exercise, check TOP's solution to compare it with yours. 
   * You should not be checking the solution for an exercise until you finish it!
   * Keep in mind that TOP's solution is not the only solution. If your solution differs wildly from TOP's solution (and still passes the self-check criteria), feel free to ask about it in the chatroom.
6. Do not submit your solutions to this repo, as any PRs that do so will be closed without merging.

## Some Hints
- The official solutions put all changes at the _end_ of the CSS file, which may duplicate some selectors (e.g. there might be a `body {}` in the given CSS, and another `body {}` in the solution). When you are working on an exercise, it is best practice to add your CSS to existing selectors instead of duplicating them at the end of the file. We're sacrificing this best practice in our official solutions to make it extra clear to you what things we changed to solve the exercise.
- Unless listed in the self-check section, do not worry about getting the exact pixel value for things like margin, padding and font-size. These exercises are intended to test your knowledge of CSS, not your ability to guess that a screenshot is using `font: sans-serif bold 16px`, or that the margin is _exactly_ `42px`.
- You may need to add some elements to your HTML to get things into the right spot. (For the first few exercises we make it explicit when this needs to happen.)
- You may need to add more selectors to your CSS file. The first few exercises have almost everything already done for you, but as you progress you'll find that you need to add more and more to get the correct result.
